mirror-scripts/
  Scripts to mirror popular projects on a private mirror on your LAN.
  See mirror-scripts/README for more info.

cointoss.pl
  For when you just can't find a quarter.

jboss.sh
  Init script to control JBoss AS. Really just used to ensure it starts on boot.

mysql_backup.sh
  Runs mysqldump against a list of databases and gzip's the result

puppet-dashboard-workers.sh
  Starts/stops the delayed_job workers for Puppet Dashboard. Finished writing
  this then realized that Puppet Labs distributes an init script along with
  the Puppet Dashboard download.

snapshotsenum.pl
  A basic script to enumerate snapshots in VMware vSphere and (optionally)
  delete them. Has a few flaws though.
